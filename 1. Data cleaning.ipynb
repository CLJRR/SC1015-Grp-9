    "## Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Data cleaning and preparation are crucial steps in the data analysis process. These steps involve transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis, and ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some key steps involved in our data cleaning and preparation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: our raw dataset is from the 2021 BRFSS survey data done by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention based on over 400,000 survey participants in the United States. The original data file can be accessed at: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html \n",
    "<br>`The original file is in XPT format, Python packages(pip) \"xport\" was used to convert into CSV`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Extraction**: the survey dataset consists of 303 columns, which contain responses for different questions asked in the survey. To identify factors releted to our research area, i.e., hypertension, extensive research was conducted. After which, relevant variable columns are identified and extracted from the survey dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning**: numerous steps were taken to clean the dataset, including tackling missing values from survey respondents, dropping irrelevant responses and removing outliers for numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Transformation**: after cleaning, the data is transformed into a format that is suitable for analysis. This involves creating new variables by manipulating existing columns and decoding categorical data into corresponding levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Documentation & Export**: the last step involves a detailed documentation of the data. Our codebook can be found in the data description file.\n",

    "### Step 1: Extract columns that are relevant to our problem, i.e., hypertension analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. `CVDINFR4 (Heart Attack)`: Hypertension, characterized by high blood pressure, puts additional strain on the heart and blood vessels, potentially leading to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t`1_INCOMG1 (Income)`: Socioeconomic factors, including income levels, can impact lifestyle choices and access to healthcare, which in turn can influence the development and management of hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\t`_RACEPRV (Race)`: Studies have found disparities in hypertension rates among different racial and ethnic populations. Factors such as genetic predisposition, cultural influences, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare disparities can contribute to these variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.\t`_SEX` (Gender)`: Men and women may have different risks and patterns of hypertension. For instance, men are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age, while women may experience an increase in blood pressure during menopause. Hormonal factors, lifestyle differences, and genetic predispositions may contribute to these gender disparities in hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\t`_RFHLTH (OVerall Health)`: Poor overall health, characterized by chronic diseases,  sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and high stress levels, can contribute to the development and worsening of hypertension. Conversely, maintaining good overall health through regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management, and proper healthcare can help prevent and manage hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\t`_PHYS14D (Physical Health)`: Individuals with poor physical health, including low levels of physical activity, unhealthy weight, and sedentary lifestyle, are at a higher risk of developing hypertension. Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and adopting a physically active lifestyle can help prevent and manage hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\t`_MENT14D (Mental Health)`: There is evidence suggesting that individuals with poor mental health, such as chronic stress, anxiety, and depression, may have an increased risk of developing hypertension. The relationship between mental health and hypertension is bidirectional, as hypertension can also contribute to mental health problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\t`_TOTINDA (Exercise)`: Regular physical activity and exercise have been found to have a significant impact on preventing and managing hypertension. Engaging in exercise can help lower blood pressure, improve cardiovascular health, enhance blood vessel function, and contribute to overall well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\t`_BMI5/_BMI5CAT (BMI)`: BMI is a measure of body weight in relation to height and is commonly used as an indicator of overall body fatness. Higher BMI levels, indicating overweight or obesity, have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension. Excess body weight puts additional strain on the cardiovascular system, leading to elevated blood pressure.\t    \n",
    "\n",
    "10.\t`_MICHD (coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI))`: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of CHD and MI. High blood pressure places increased stress on the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. Over time, this can lead to the development of atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) and increase the risk of CHD or MI\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `_RFCHOL3 (Cholesterol):High levels of cholesterol can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which narrows the arteries and increases blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. `_LTASTH1 (Asthma)`: Asthma has been found to be associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, factors such as chronic inflammation, medication use, and impaired lung function in individuals with asthma may contribute to the development of hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. `DIABETE4 (Diabetes)`: High blood sugar levels in diabetes can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of hypertension. Conversely, hypertension can impair insulin sensitivity and worsen diabetes control.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. `_DRNKWK1 (Alcohol Consumption)`: Drinking alcohol in large quantities can raise blood pressure and also interfere with the effectiveness of hypertension medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. `_FRUTSU1 (Fruit Consumption)`: Consuming an adequate amount of fruits per day is beneficial for overall health, including blood pressure management. Fruits are rich in potassium, fiber, and antioxidants, which can help lower blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. `_VEGESU1` (Vegetable Consumption): Similar to fruit consumption, a sufficient intake of vegetables per day is associated with lower blood pressure levels. Vegetables are nutrient-dense and high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber, all of which contribute to healthy blood pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "17. `_SMOKER3` (Smoking): The chemicals in tobacco smoke can damage blood vessels, increase heart rate, and elevate blood pressure. Quitting smoking is crucial in managing hypertension and reducing the risk of associated complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. `_CURECI1` (E-Cigarette Use): The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is a relatively new area of research, and its direct relationship with hypertension is not yet fully understood. However, some studies suggest that e-cigarette use may have negative cardiovascular effects and potentially contribute to hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "19.\t`_RFHYPE6` (High Blood Pressure): Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition characterized by elevated arterial pressure and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modifications, medication, and regular monitoring are key to managing hypertension and reducing associated health risks."

    "\n",
    "For numeric variables,it is important to examine the presence of outliers. In our study, considering that the survey data is obtained from US citizens, it is possible that some respondents may have provided inaccurate or false information, resulting in the presence of outliers. These outliers can distort data visualization, such as scatter plots or histograms, making it challenging to interpret the data accurately. \n",

    "Additionally, outliers can disproportionately influence predictive models, leading to inaccurate predictions. By conducting an outlier analysis, we can identify and eliminate anomalies in the data, ensuring a more reliable foundation for further exploratory data analysis."
